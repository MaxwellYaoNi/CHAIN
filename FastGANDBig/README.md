# Code For CHAIN+FastGANDBig

### Download [Inception model](https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/metrics/inception-2015-12-05.pt) to path
```
data/inception_model
```
The inception model is converted from Tensorflow to Pytorch by work [StyleGAN2]().

### Preparing your Data
 you can download data from [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAJCZbXNHyraJ6Mi13dSbe7pTyfPXha0/view) provided by [FastGAN](https://github.com/odegeasslbc/FastGAN-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file) and extract it into 
```
data/[yourdataset]
```

### Preparing the moments used for calculating FID
```
python3 calculating.py
```

### Runing the code

### some experience that could be used for better performance.
